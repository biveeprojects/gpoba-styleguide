[A few sentences on why we're using these colors.]

### Primary palette

Blue and dark purple are the main colors of GPOBA's primary palette, with a range of neutrals in between.

<%= partial "components/swatch_grid", :locals => { :swatches => data.color.primary } %>

### Alternate highlights

Blue is the 'default' highlight color, but these secondary highlights are available if you need a broader palette.

<%= partial "components/swatch_grid", :locals => { :swatches => data.color.alternate } %>
