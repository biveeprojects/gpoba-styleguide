## Convener
Part of GPOBA’s goal is to bring different stakeholders together to engage in RBF/OBA discourse and continuously advance the field. GPOBA is positioned as an organization capable of bringing Donors, World Bank Teams, Project Implementers, Private Sector organizations, and Peers together. GPOBA has a solid base of support, but can improve its position with more active promoters and advocates. As a convener, GPOBA will be able to shape conversations, increase awareness, and increasingly be seen as a leader in development finance.

A key component of this Strategic Area is the involvement of the Private Sector in GPOBA’s convening activities. All audience groups consulted saw the importance of private sector inclusion and partnership, and GPOBA’s track record of private sector engagement was highlighted.

## Center of Expertise
GPOBA continues to develop as a center of expertise, and showcasing its wide array of successes and expertise around RBF/OBA continues to play a central role in its engagement activities.
The focus of this objective is effective storytelling and the development of consistent case studies. Stakeholders routinely indicated that GPOBA had achieved impact, but was not showcasing this effectively. Through creating more effective narratives, using technology to scale its impact, and participating in shaping discourse through strategic partnerships, GPOBA will be able to showcase its status as a center of expertise.

## Integral Part of Development Finance
RBF/OBA play an important role as approaches to development finance, particularly when employed with other financing mechanisms. GPOBA’s goal is to increase the perception that RBF/OBA is an integral part of the development finance toolkit.
This objective is focused on building mechanisms to educate stakeholders on which development financing approaches are most effective to achieve particular goals and the contexts in which RBF/OBA is most impactful. This builds on the convening and storytelling components of the engagement strategy in order to develop the partnerships and messages necessary to adequately convey the importance of RBF/OBA. This will increase the number of RBF/OBA projects, broaden the pool of donor funds that are allocated to this methodology, and ultimately provide more effective services to communities that need it the most.
