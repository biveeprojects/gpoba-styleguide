Values represent an ideal goal to strive for, while Activities represent the manner an organization operates. Messaging combines those Values and Activities to **communicate** how an organization will achieve its values through its activities. Messaging refers to how you talk about your work and your beliefs so that it is both **understandable** and **relatable**, and looks at the bigger picture to create a c**onnection with your audience**. GPOBA’s Messaging focuses on being **empathetic**, **accessible**, and **accountable**.

###GPOBA’s Core Message

GPOBA’s message falls under three categories: reaching underserved populations, accessing new markets, and verifying results and outputs. GPOBA’s core message is therefore: **_We Bring Development to Communities: We partner with donors and the private sector to improve lives and achieve measurable results._**

This is the message that should be used in general circumstances when asked questions like “what does GPOBA do?” or “how does GPOBA work?” Note that this message is focused on organizational message, and not on RBF/OBA subject matter. Below are examples of statements that can open conversations around what GPOBA does, for whom, and how.

<u><strong>Structuring a GPOBA Message</strong></u>


GPOBA <strong>[   action phrase   ]</strong> for <strong>[   audience   ]</strong> by  <strong>[   how phrase  ]</strong>

<u><strong>Reaching underserved populations</strong></u>

GPOBA provides services to reach those who do not have access traditional development projects. The very nature of why GPOBA was founded was to help people who do not normally have access to development financing to improve the quality of life on the ground.

**Core Message**: GPOBA improves communities through innovative financing for basic services.

<u><strong>Accesses new markets</strong></u>

GPOBA reaches areas where traditional development financing and aid is not able to access. Risk mitigation is an integral part of Development Finance, and emphasizing that GPOBA opens new markets for private investors puts GPOBA in a prime position to find new opportunities, and create an environment so all stakeholders benefit from the project(s) and are protected.

**Core Message**: GPOBA partners with you to make projects work in hard places.

<u><strong>Verifies results and outputs</strong></u>

GPOBA as an RBF/OBA practitioner creates accountability by independently verifying that projects are actively achieving their desired goals and objectives. This is core to GPOBA’s activities, and the very mechanism that differentiates GPOBA’s work from other groups working in different areas of Development Finance.

**Core Message**: GPOBA designs innovative projects that measurably improve communities.

###GPOBA’s Core Messages by Audience

The four primary audience groups have different interests when it comes to engaging with GPOBA. GPOBA’s message should then be tailored to the specific interests of different audience groups. These messages are far more personal given that there is some sort of familiarity with GPOBA.

<u><strong>Structuring an Audience Message</strong></u>


We **[   benefit phrase   ]**. We **[   how we provide benefit   ]** to  **[   impact phrase  ]**

<u><strong>Donors</strong></u>

Donors seek out GPOBA because of its results, specifically around the number of people who have benefited, the amount of funds disbursed, and the accountability it provides by independently verifying that project outputs and results are achieved. Donors are interested in who received aid, what where the outputs, outcomes, and impact, and who else can benefit from RBF/OBA projects. Donors are further interested in sharing this information with others to show that they themselves are achieving their own mandates.

**Message**: We partner with the private sector to achieve results in communities where it matters most.

<u><strong>World Bank Group</strong></u>

Internal World Bank teams are constantly sourcing funds for projects that need financing. TTLs often are managing various stakeholders and are subject matter experts in their respective fields, but not on financing. TTLs often need additional guidance of transaction advisors, and engage with GPOBA in order to quickly and effectively fund part of, or an entire project. TTLs also engage with GPOBA at the request of their client.

**Message**: We help you achieve better results for your projects with our approach and expertise.

<u><strong>Implementing Agencies & Private Sector</strong></u>

Private sector clients are focused on de-risking opportunities, and gaining access to new markets that would otherwise be closed to them. GPOBA acts as a bridge that provides access to these markets, and provides a mechanism that can reduce corruption, and improve transparency.

**Message**: We help you succeed in new markets with our demonstrated approach and expertise.

<u><strong>Peers & Affiliates</strong></u>

Peers and Affiliates are concerned about advancing how RBF/OBA can be improved and implemented. They are focused on being part of the conversation around RBF/OBA and be thought leaders in the area. They are interested in knowledge sharing and discussions around RBF/OBA.


**Message**: We bring people together to improve development results for communities.
