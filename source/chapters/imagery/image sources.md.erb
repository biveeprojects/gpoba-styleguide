Images, where possible, should be used from actual GPOBA projects and clients. However, images can be sources from the [World Bank Flickr site ](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/)  as well as the [United Nations Flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/un_photo/). Additionally, images may be purchased from stock image sources such as Shutterstock (SURR has an account that is available) and iStock photos. Finally, Creative Commons images can be used as long as the photographer is properly attributed; these images can be found on Flickr by selecting the license type required ([here](https://www.flickr.com/search/?dimension_search_mode=min&height=1024&width=1024&license=4%2C5%2C6%2C9%2C10&text=&advanced=1)).
