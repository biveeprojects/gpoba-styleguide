Focus on selecting images that show the communities that GPOBA works in and highlighting the people, their lives, and the value GPOBA may be adding. Do not look for images that showcase poverty or abase the target audiences.

In general, images should:
- Be uplifting, hopeful, and empathize with the people that are being highlighted
- Highlight a wide array of ages - not just one age range.
- Include images from as many regions as possible (where feasible) - they should not focus on only one region or ethnicity
- Focus on one or two primary subjects and will predominantly be portrait images and not focus on aerial, city or landscape images.
- If images do not contain people, they should be images of project outputs - for example solar panels, pumps, or other examples of impact of a GPOBA project
