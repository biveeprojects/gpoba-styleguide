GPOBA’s tone is approachable, but it is always more important to be clear than overly simplistic. Like a teacher, GPOBA’s tone should adapt to the technical abilities of its audience. Development Finance is not a subject all people will be familiar with, and using understandable language should be at the forefront of your speech considerations. Think of your audience - do they know what RBF/OBA is? Are they confused and seeking guidance on a matter they are not familiar with? Are they curious about specific technical elements of an OBA approach? Once you know their level of understanding and knowledge of RBF/OBA, you can adjust your tone and language accordingly.

For example, a Power Engineer is highly technical in their field, but is most likely not as familiar in finance terminology. Discussing Value for Money or Portfolio Approaches might intimidate them or distract them from communicating their needs.
