The message we are trying to communicate is that GPOBA is bringing Development to Communities. Our voice is relatable, experienced, and human. Our motive is to help people by being straightforward and direct without being intimidating. GPOBA’s voice should be simple, and like that of a teacher: it should aim to simplify and make complex content understandable and engage the listener.

One way to think of our voice is to think of what GPOBA is versus what it is not. GPOBA is:

- **Approachable, but not patronizing**
- **Innovative, but not experimental**
- **Adaptive, but not disorganized**
- **Experienced, but not overbearing**

An example of a way of talking about GPOBA that is consistent with this voice is provided below:

<em><strong>Previous Voice (What we might have said in the past):</strong></em>

_Through a diverse portfolio of projects, GPOBA funds, designs, demonstrates, and documents output-based aid approaches (OBA) to improve the delivery of basic services in  developing  countries._

_Note_: This description of GPOBA is not inaccurate, but the words chosen are less approachable and clear than the voice GPOBA intends to portray. The following example demonstrates how we can talk about the same concept using language that is consistent with GPOBA’s voice.

<em><strong>Current Voice (How we want to talk about GPOBA today):</strong></em>

_GPOBA works on a variety of projects that use output-based aid approaches to provide basic services to communities that are traditionally harder to access. GPOBA can help you fund, design, evaluate, and document OBA projects._

**Conventions & Word Choice**

To stay consistent with GPOBA’s intended voice, below are some high-level, general rules of thumb to remember when talking about GPOBA. This section will likely change and evolve over time and is not meant to be exhaustive.

<strong><em>Remember the following:</em></strong>

- **Avoid using the term “sustainability” on its own**. This term is often used very generically but has very technical implications in the world of OBA. Instead, if you need to address the concept of sustainability, be sure to qualify what kind of sustainability you’re referring to. For example:
    - Financial sustainability
    - Environmental sustainability
    - Operational sustainability
    -
- **Distinguish between outcomes, outputs, and impacts.** These three terms can have very different technical implications in the world of development finance. Some examples of the differences between these terms include:
    - Outputs => powerline
    - Outcome => people have electricity
    - Impact => people can read at night

- **Avoid Acronyms where possible.** Don’t assume the technical background of your audience. Also, acronyms can be impersonal and diminish the connection the audience has with the content.

- **Use active voice as much as possible.** Avoid passive voice.

- **Use the word "communities" vs. people.** Emphasizing communities helps
highlight GPOBA’s goal of engaging more than the individuals in a space and has a connotation of cooperation and inclusiveness.

- **Use RBF/OBA vs. OBA/RBF.** As output-based aid is a form of results-based financing, it makes hierarchal sense to refer to the broader category, RBF, first.

- **Consider cultural differences in language.** If content will need to be translated into another language, prioritize clarity and avoid ambiguity to ensure your sentences are clear for translation.

- **Make language as accessible as possible.** Use plain language and ask yourself whether the content would make sense to a third party who is not involved with GPOBA.
