When developing content or preparing to communicate with stakeholders, remember that each audience has different preferences, priorities, needs, backgrounds, and familiarity with GPOBA. To strike the right tone, keep the following information about your audience in mind, in additional to the specific context in which you are communicating with them. For example, within each each audience, the tone may need to differ depending on the formality of the event or the technical background of a sub-group of people. Also, be sure to consider cultural implications of your tone.
