This section outlines how to write a narrative and provides some general conventions and word choices to consider. It also provides guidance around how to structure tone and voice when communicating with others outside of GPOBA. These elements are meant to be a broad guide that helps shape how narratives are formed and stories are told rather than a rule book.

An easy way to think about GPOBA is as if it were a person: how GPOBA talks about itself and interacts with others creates a personality that can help you as a team member also sound like GPOBA.

In this section, we will talk about GPOBA’s voice and tone. One way to think about these concepts is that GPOBA uses the same voice over and over each day - the core messages, values, and personality should remain consistent in each of GPOBA’s interactions and communications. Its tone, however, may vary depending upon the audience.  For example, GPOBA’s tone would be different when it is addressing donors during a formal annual meeting, versus when it is on the ground talking with direct beneficiaries in Bangladesh, versus when it is speaking with undergraduate students about case studies.
