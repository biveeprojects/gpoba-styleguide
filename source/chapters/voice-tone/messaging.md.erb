As described in GPOBA’s Engagement Strategy, GPOBA’s core messages are centered around **reaching underserved populations, accessing new markets, and verifying results and outputs.** This section provides tips for employing an appropriate voice and tone when communicating with stakeholders around these core messages.

### When we talk about **reaching underserved populations,** we want to demonstrate how GPOBA helps **communities** of people.

**Why? The very people we want to help are those who need assistance, not handouts.**

* Lead by talking about groups of people, people’s needs
* Describe people’s situations, not their state (e.g., people in poor places, not poor people)
* Emphasize independence and opportunities, not reliance

### When we talk about **accessing new markets**, we want to demonstrate how GPOBA is **innovative**.

**Why? We want to bring change and progress, not barriers.**

* Lead by talking about making safe environments for people
* Describe how to simplify situations, not complicate them
* Emphasize how GPOBA reaches people and places that are traditionally difficult to access

### When we talk about **verifying results and outputs,** we want to demonstrate how GPOBA brings **accountability**.

**Why? We want to bring transparency and confidence, not bureaucracy.**

* Lead by talking about how projects measurably improve communities
* Describe how GPOBA independently verifies outputs and objectives  
* Emphasize long term effects and change, not instant gratification
