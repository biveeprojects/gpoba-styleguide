In general, layout for GPOBA collateral should emphasize clarity, readability, and simplicity. Allow generous whitespace and try to stay out of the way of the content. Try to keeps boxes, fluorishes, and extraneous layout elements to a bare minimum: if it doesn't serve a clear layout purpose, it shouldn't be there. Instead, try to define the visual hierarchy with proportion, typographic detail, and color.
