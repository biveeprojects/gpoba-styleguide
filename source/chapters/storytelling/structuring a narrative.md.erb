This section provides high-level guidelines for telling a compelling narrative when communicating with stakeholders about GPOBA.

The Freytag Pyramid is a simple structure that should be used when telling a story. This method can be effectively used to make stories more memorable by highlighting its key components: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. A story can be more complicated than this— for example, it may have multiple climaxes—but the general structure of a story worth telling aligns with this framework.

### 1. Exposition

The exposition is the opening of the story, including a reader’s introduction to characters and settings. This is often the point in the story where your audience begins to “invest” in your characters. The audience will begin to empathize and root for the characters’ eventual victory as the story describes their history, circumstances, and aspirations. The greater your audience’s investment in the characters, the greater the impact of the rising action and climax to follow.

Some questions to consider when developing your story’s exposition include:

- Who is the person or community we are telling a story about?
- What do we know about this person or community?
    - What are their motivations?
    - What are their emotions?
    - Where are they located?
    - What do they do (work, life, hobbies)?
    - What are their goals?
- Are there others who are facing similar situations (i.e. are they unique)?


### 2. Rising Action


A story’s rising action consists of a series of events that create uncertainty or complications for your characters and result in increased drama or suspense. By reminding the audience of the consequences your characters face if they fail (i.e., how this will hurt their ability to achieve their aspirations), they will feel a stronger desire to see the characters’ victory. These are the rising “stakes” of the story.

- What is the issue this person or community is facing (i.e. why do they need help)?
    - How does this issue affect what they do?
    - What “questions” or uncertainties does this issue create for this person?
- What are the consequences of these issues if not corrected?
- Were there any previous attempts to help with this issue? If so, how did they fail, and how might the current attempt have difference results?
- Are there any complications to resolving this issue?


### 3. Climax


The climax is the critical moment at which your characters confront the problems or questions they are trying to resolve. The consequences of this moment define both the main action and stakes of the story: the character will either overcome their obstacle or they will be defeated.

- How did GPOBA identify the issue that needed solving? / How did GPOBA work with the community to identify and resolve the issue?
- What were the steps GPOBA took to start resolving the problem?
- Who did GPOBA partner with to work on the problem? / What were the priorities of the community, GPOBA, and partners at this point in the story?


### 4. Falling Action


The falling action is a series of events that unfold after the climax and lead to the end of the story.

- What made the project difficult to implement? / What difficulties were faced by GPOBA/the community/stakeholders?
- What made the project easier to implement?
- What did we learn as we were implementing?
- What are some of the results from the intervention by GPOBA? / How did the community respond to the intervention?


### 5. Resolution


The end of the story, in which the problems are resolved (or not resolved, depending on the story.)

- Reflect back to the Exposition and Rising Action – were the issues resolved?
    - Did the person or community receive the benefit they needed?
    - Was the intervention a success or failure?
- What were the results of the project
    - Human Results – how many people were impacted?
    - Social Results – how did the community benefit?
    - Financial Results – what was invested, and what resources were used to achieve these results?
- What could be improved?
- What worked well in the project?

### Summarizing a Story

This approach can be summarized into shorter stories that can be used in conversation. When writing a longer story, a shorter snippet should be written that includes at most 3-5 sentences and messagcan be told in 30 seconds. These can be used to create interest in the story and are meant to grab attention and prompt the listener or reader to ask more questions.

Each publication should ideally include a short summary that can be repurposed in other communication channels, such as social media, blogs, or other headlines.
